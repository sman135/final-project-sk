Contact info: spencerfkolman@lewisu.edu

Code is all original but work is based on "clicker" game applications.

To use you need to execute "spences_cookie_clicker.py" in Terminal/Command Prompt with python3. For example you would type "python3 spences_cookie_clicker.py" and then press return/enter to execute the program.
